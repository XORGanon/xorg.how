## Document(s) status
All structure-content is WIP, so all can access. Before embarking into making greater changes, make a full offline copy so that we can go back if we like to find sth back.

## Nomenclature
So far discussed:
#### ``ambiguous expression``
- written: ``æ``, plural ``æs``
- spoken: ``ame``, plural ``ames``
- code: ``[<facet_1>|<facet_2>|...|<facet_n>]``, e.g.: ``[cyan|blue|turquoise]``

## To do
- æ facet replacement: swap facets not by replacing the full span but by "erasing" the shown span, letter by letter from end to start, and subsequently constructing in the thus far hidden one, letter by letter from start to end.
