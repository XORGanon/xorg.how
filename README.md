## Location and file status
### Location
Presently, we have files in two locations:
- FTP server
- This repo

#### FTP server
Managed by Pablo.
Current access: Pablo and Martin. 
The public website is hosted on the FTP server. To try out functions and play with the design, we can make personal sandbox folders. This way, everyone can test online and have others see their work without affecting the public website.

#### This repo
Managed by Martin.
The idea is that the HTML, CSS and Javascript code on the server scaffold the website's design and functionality, the text that will be shown is drawn from this Github repo. 
Files in this repo provide the data that will be shown on the website. That is, the HTML and other code on the FTP server gives the frame for how to render the website, the content for which it draws from here. (Note to self, insert link to file.) 
This is done so that independent of coding fluency, all of us can partake in changing the website.
All data in this repo is WIP, so all be free to edit. (Note to self, insert notes on syntax.) Before embarking into making greater changes, make a full offline copy so that we can go back if we like to find sth back.


## Nomenclature
So far discussed:
#### ``ambiguous expression``
- written: ``æ`` or ``ae``, plural ``æs`` or ``aes``
- spoken: ``ame``, plural ``ames``
- code: ``[<facet_1>|<facet_2>|...|<facet_n>]``, e.g.: ``[cyan|blue|turquoise]``
